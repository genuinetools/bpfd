Framework for running BPF programs with rules on Linux as a daemon. Container aware.

### NOTE: WIP If you want to contribute see "How it Works" below and consider adding more example rules or programs. Thanks!!

### How it Works

Currently the programs are in the [program/ folder](program). The idea is
that you can add any tracers you would like and then create [rules](examples) for
them.

**Programs** retrieve the data... **Rules** filter the data... **Actions** perform actions on the data


**Programs**

The programs that exist today are based off a few
[bcc-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) programs. Writing
these requires knowledge of BPF but you can use the base provided here to
create your own programs and add them in a fork, if you so wish for say an
enterprise who doesn't want others to reverse engineer what they are tracing and
how they alert.

**Rules**

These are toml files that hold some logic for what you would like to trace. You
can search for anything returned by a `Program` in it's `map[string]string`
data struct.

You can also filter based off the container runtime you would like to alert on.

**Actions**

COMING SOON

There will also be an interface for actions. That way you can send alerts 
on the rules you set up to Slack, email, or even run arbitrary code so you can
kill a container, pause a container, or checkpoint a container to restore it
elsewhere without even having to login to a computer.
