Framework for running BPF tracers with rules on Linux as a daemon. Container aware.

This is not just "yet another tool to trace"...

Since it uses BPF and allows for any implementation of the `Tracer` interface you
can use it to do all sorts of things from modifying a file everytime a call to `open` is
called on it, to hot patching an internal kernel function to prevent a known vulnerability
without the need to upgrade your kernel.

More use cases with examples coming soon... for now see [how it works](#how-it-works).

## How it Works

[**Tracers**](#tracers) retrieve the data...
[**Rules**](#rules) filter the data...
[**Actions**](#actions) perform actions on the data.

The tracers are in the [tracer/ folder](tracer).
The idea is that you can add any tracers you would like
and then create [rules](examples) for the data retrieved from the tracers.
Any events with data that passes the filters will be passed on to the specified
action.

### Tracers

The tracers that exist today are based off a few
[bcc-tools](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc) tracers.

You could always add your own tracers in a fork if you worry people will
reverse engineer the data you are collecting and alerting on.

The current compiled in tracers are:

- [bashreadline](tracer/bashreadline): trace commands being entered into
    the bash command line
- [exec](tracer/exec): trace calls to exec binaries
- [open](tracer/open): trace calls to open files

These must implement the `Tracer` interface:

```go
// Tracer defines the basic capabilities of a tracer.
type Tracer interface {
    // Load creates the bpf module and starts collecting the data for the tracer.
    Load() error
    // Unload closes the bpf module and all the probes that all attached to it.
    Unload()
    // WatchEvent defines the function to watch the events for the tracer.
    WatchEvent() (*grpc.Event, error)
    // Start starts the map for the tracer.
    Start()
    // String returns a string representation of this tracer.
    String() string
}
```

As you can see from above you could _technically_ implement this interface with
something other than BPF ;)

The `Event` type defines the data returned from the tracer. As you can see
below, the `Data` is of type `map[string]string` meaning any key value pair can
be returned for the data. The rules then filter using those key value pairs.

```go
// Event defines the data struct for holding event data.
type Event struct {
    PID              uint32            // Process ID.
    TGID             uint32            // Task group ID.
    Data             map[string]string
    ContainerRuntime string            // Filled in after the tracer is run so you don't need to.
    ContainerID      string            // Filled in after the tracer is run so you don't need to.
    Tracer           string            // Filled in after the tracer is run so you don't need to.
}
```

### Rules

These are toml files that hold some logic for what you would like to trace.
You can search for anything returned by a `Tracer` in its `map[string]string`
data struct.

You can also filter based off the container runtime you would like to alert on.
The container runtime must be one of the strings defined
[here](https://github.com/genuinetools/bpfd/blob/master/proc/proc.go#L24).

If you provide no rules for a tracer, then _all_ the events will be passed to
actions.

The example below describes a rule file to filter the data returned from the
`exec` tracer. Events from `exec` will only be returned if the `command` matches
one of those values AND the container runtime is `docker` or `kube`.

```toml
tracer = "exec"

actions = ["stdout"]

[filterEvents]
  [filterEvents.command]
  values = ["sshd", "dbus-daemon-lau", "ping", "ping6", "critical-stack-", "pmmcli", "filemng", "PassengerAgent", "bwrap", "osdetect", "nginxmng", "sw-engine-fpm", "start-stop-daem"]

containerRuntimes = ["docker","kube"]
```

If you are wondering where the `command` key comes from, it's defined in the
`exec` tracer [here](https://github.com/genuinetools/bpfd/blob/master/tracer/exec/exec.go#L200).

Rules can be dynamically controlled via bpfd's [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) interface.
The cli tool can also be used for creating rules dynamically, see 
[`create` usage](#create-rules-dynamically).

The protobuf protocol definition is defined in [api/grpc/api.proto](https://github.com/genuinetools/bpfd/blob/master/api/grpc/api.proto)

To interact with the gRPC api you can use the [`--gpc-addr` flag](#usage)
or the default is a sock at `/run/bpfd/bpfd.sock`.

### Actions

Actions do "something" on an event. This way you can send filtered events to
Slack, email, or even run arbitrary code. You could
kill a container, pause a container, or checkpoint a container to restore it
elsewhere without even having to login to a computer.

The current compiled in actions are:

- [stdout](action/stdout): print to stdout
- [kill](action/kill): kill the process
- [interrupt](action/interrupt): interrupt the process

Actions implement the `Actions` interface:

```go
// Action performs an action on an event.
type Action interface {
    // Do runs the action on an event.
    Do(event *grpc.Event) error
    // String returns a string representation of this tracer.
    String() string
}
```

## Installation

To build, you need to have `libbcc` installed [SEE INSTRUCTIONS HERE](https://github.com/iovisor/bcc/blob/master/INSTALL.md)


#### Binaries

For installation instructions from binaries please visit the [Releases Page](https://github.com/genuinetools/bpfd/releases).

#### Via Go

```console
$ go get github.com/genuinetools/bpfd
```

#### Via Docker

```console
$ docker run --rm -it \
    --name bpfd \
    -v /lib/modules:/lib/modules:ro \
    -v /usr/src:/usr/src:ro \
    --privileged \
    r.j3ss.co/bpfd daemon
```

## Usage

```console
$ bpfd -h
bpfd -  Framework for running BPF tracers with rules on Linux as a daemon.

Usage: bpfd <command>

Flags:

  -d, --debug  enable debug logging (default: false)
  --grpc-addr  Address for gRPC api communication (default: /run/bpfd/bpfd.sock)

Commands:

  create   Create one or more rules.
  daemon   Start the daemon.
  ls       List rules.
  rm       Remove one or more rules.
  trace    Live trace the events returned after filtering.
  version  Show the version information.
```

### Run the daemon

You can preload rules by passing `--rules-dir` to the command or placing
rules in the default directory: `/etc/bpfd/rules`.

```console
$ bpfd daemon -h
Usage: bpfd daemon [OPTIONS]

Start the daemon.

Flags:

  -d, --debug  enable debug logging (default: false)
  --grpc-addr  Address for gRPC api communication (default: /run/bpfd/bpfd.sock)
  --rules-dir  Directory that stores the rules files (default: /etc/bpfd/rules)
```

### Create rules dynamically

You can create rules on the fly with the `create` command. You can pass more
than one file at a time.

```console
Usage: bpfd create [OPTIONS] RULE_FILE [RULE_FILE...]

Create one or more rules.

Flags:

  -d, --debug  enable debug logging (default: false)
  --grpc-addr  Address for gRPC api communication (default: /run/bpfd/bpfd.sock)
```

### Remove rules dynamically

You can delete rules with the `rm` command. You can pass more than one
rule name at a time.

```console
$ bpfd rm -h
Usage: bpfd rm [OPTIONS] RULE_NAME [RULE_NAME...]

Remove one or more rules.

Flags:

  -d, --debug  enable debug logging (default: false)
  --grpc-addr  Address for gRPC api communication (default: /run/bpfd/bpfd.sock)
```

### List active rules

You can list the rules that the daemon is filtering with by using the `ls`
command.

```console
$ bpfd ls
NAME                TRACER
bashreadline        bashreadline
password_files      open
setuid_binaries     exec
```

### Live tracing events

You can live trace the events returned after filtering with the `trace`
command.

This does not include past events. Consider it like a tail.

```console
$ bpfd trace
INFO[0000] map[string]string{"filename":"/etc/shadow", "command":"sudo", "returnval":"4"}  container_id= container_runtime=not-found pid=12893 tracer=open tgid=0
